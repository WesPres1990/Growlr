## About
Much like eHarmoney, Growlr uses a series of questions to try and match the perfect ownder to the perfect dog breed. 


## How to Use
The application is hosted on Heroku: [Growlr](https://warm-sierra-75928.herokuapp.com)

If the user is a person, he or she clicks the button "Human Looking For Dog". A form opens up, where they provide their basic information (name, address, email, age, etc) along with a photograph of themselves, and following this is a survey where they provide answers to questions and statements using drop-down choices. Upon completing the survey, the user clicks "Submit" and is shown the dog with whom he or she has the most compatibility based on the answers which were given.

If the user is a person or company (animal shelter, PetSmart, etc.) acting on behalf of a dog - known as a "Sponsor" - he or she clicks the button "Dog Looking For Human". In the following form page, the sponsor provides the dog's basic information (name, breed, age, etc) as well as their own information (peronal or company name, address, phone number, etc.) and a photo of the dog. Following this is a survey where they provide answers to questions and statements about the dog using drop-down choices. Upon completing the survey, the user clicks "Submit" and is shown the person with whom the dog has the most compatibility based on the answers which were given.

App also contains a link to the JSON data, which contains an array of people ("friends") and their scores, which are compared against data from the user to determine compatibility.


## Built With
Friend Finder is a full stack node app deployed on [Heroku](https://warm-sierra-75928.herokuapp.com). Data is saved in a file, not in a database. The application uses the express npm package to configure and operate the server, body-parser to pass the json data back and forth between files & functions, and fs to read & write from the data files on the server. Various routes are setup to complete the survey, view the JSON API, and post data into the app. A general catch-all route will bring all users to the homepage, regardless of the path the user attempts to access.

### Technologies Used

Languages - HTML5, CSS4, Boostrap, Javascript

Run-time System - Node.js

Database - MySQL

Package Manager - NPM

Other Tools, Technologies, and Techniques - API Routes, Handlebars, MVC

Text Editor - Visual Studio Code

## Application Structure
Code for running the modules is located in the root of the application

```
Growlr/server.js
```

The code to display the survey page with fields name, link to photo, and 6 dropdown questions for the user to choose to find the best match, and a submit button.  Another link to list all dogs' details in json format, and another to git repository. And a modal to display the result (best match). Handlebars is used to standardize css, and js bootstrap to format the page and components.

`growlr` is a full stack node app deployed on Heroku. Data is saved on a file, not in a database. It uses [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) to configure and operate the server, [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) to pass the json data back and forth between files & functions, and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) to read & write from the data files on the server. The templating engine is [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) Various routes are setup to complete the survey, view the JSON API, and post data into the app. A general catch-all route will bring all users to the homepage, regardless of the path the user attempts to access.
[Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) and
[Mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) are also critical to the project.

Growlr implements dog matching based on the user's and dog owner's responses to a six question survey. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, an existing user record closest to the current user's responses is found and returned. The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for all six questions combined.

Growlr application is meant to simulate a simple dating app. The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and the bootstrap and handlebars CSS framework on the front end.
